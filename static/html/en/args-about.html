      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          <b>args</b>, aka <b>args.me</b>, is the first search engine for arguments on the web. It is non-commercial and independent from industry. Established in 2017, <b>args</b> is still in an early stage of development and will be periodically updated.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>args</b> is meant to be used by anyone. It aims to support people in forming opinions on controversial issues in a self-determined manner. <b>args</b> searches pro and con arguments for any issue on reliable web platforms, and it assesses their relevance using methods from computational argumentation research. We believe that the identification of traceable high-quality arguments is of continuously increasing importance in times of fake news and alternative facts. So, if Google cannot help you, then maybe <b>args.me</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The software and data underlying <b>args</b> serve as an environment for collaborative research on computational argumentation and its practical evaluation. We invite researchers and practitioners to participate in the ongoing development of <b>args</b>. While we aim to make the software and data as open as possible, notice that this may sometimes take a while due to our limited capacities.
          For more information, see the scientific paper <a href="http://argumentation.bplaced.net/arguana-publications/papers/wachsmuth17e-argmining.pdf" target="_blank">"Building an Argument Search Engine for the Web"</a> where <b>args</b> is introduced.

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          Why a parrot logo? Well, just imagine the sounds parrots come up with themselves. Isn't <b>args</b> one of them? Even more, parrots can talk, of course. Yes, many parrots just parrot, and this is actually what <b>args</b> currently does, too: it parrots arguments made by humans. But some parrots are also able to lead conversations, especially those that have interacted with humans for a long time. That is a nice prospect for an argument search engine, no?

          The idea of an argument search engine has been developed at the <a href="http://www.webis.de" target"_blank">Webis group</a> of the Bauhaus-Universit&auml;t Weimar in Weimar, Germany. The main people behind the idea are

          <b>args</b> can be seen as a prototype implementation of the idea. It has been developed by Jana Puschmann, Jiani Qu, and Jonas Dorsch, based on code and data provided by Janek Bevendorff and Viorel Morari, all as part of their studies at the Bauhaus-Universit&auml;t Weimar. Jana, Jiani, and Jonas also coined the name <b>args</b> and came up with the design of the parrot logo.
